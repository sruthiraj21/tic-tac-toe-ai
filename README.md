# Tic Tac Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## Project Overview
This project implements an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game where a human plays against an AI.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible future moves and always chooses the optimal move.

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Unbeatable AI
- Reset Game button
- Game result detection (Win / Draw)
- Clean and responsive UI

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Minimax Algorithm (Game Theory)

## How It Works
The Minimax algorithm recursively explores all possible game states.
- +10 score for AI win
- -10 score for Human win
- 0 score for Draw

The AI selects the move that maximizes its score while minimizing the opponent’s chances of winning.
